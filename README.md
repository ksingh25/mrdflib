# mrdflib
mRDFLib is a fork and port of [RDFLib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib) for micropython. It is a library for working with RDF. 
It is a work in progress and the goal is to make the code and memory footprint as small as possible. 
Currently several functionalities like XML, isodate, Decimal (and thus _XSD_DECIMAL, _XSD_DATETIME, _XSD_DATE, etc.) are not working. Notation3 parser needs some more debugging.

mRDFLib has been tested by compiling [micropython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) on Linux and ESP32 (with 4MB PSRAM for example esp32-one, ESP32 cam, ESP32-S3 with PSRAM etc. Note that ESP32-S3 is new and needs a separate firmware compilation.).

## Prerequisites
To test it quickly, one either needs linux with python3 or ESP32 with 4MB of SPIRAM. 
For testing over ESP32, one needs to install [IDF (tested with v4.0.2)](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) as well as tools like adafruit-ampy, picocom The last two can be installed using `sudo apt-get install adapfruit-ampy picocom`. For installing IDF one has to follow instructions provided in the README.md file in micropython/ports/esp32/ folder of micropython.

Note that IDF is needed to compile firmware of micropython for ESP32. 
Other alternative is to just [download the compiled firmware from here](https://github.com/ksingh25/Files).

## Linux 
To test it on Linux, please compile the [micropython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) with all REGEX options supported by micropython. This can be done by modifying the file micropython/ports/unix/mpconfigport.h

and adding the following (after `#ifndef MICROPY_UNIX_MINIMAL` for example)

```
#define MICROPY_PY_URE_SUB 40
#define MICROPY_PY_URE_MATCH_GROUPS         (1)
#define MICROPY_PY_URE_MATCH_SPAN_START_END (1)
```
Then compile micropython following the README.md instructions in the folder micropython/ports/unix.

## ESP32
For quick test, you may flash ESP32 with the firmware that was already compiled and is [available here](https://github.com/ksingh25/Files). Mostly firmware.bin is needed. One needs to flash ESP32 with this firmware. In this case one may skip the instructions 
for compilation provided in this section.

To compile micropython and test it on ESP32, please first install [IDF (tested with v4.0.2)](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf).

After that please download [micropython code](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) 
cd to `micropython/ports/esp32` directory and then compile and flash the firware
check some intial steps [here](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/ports/esp32/README.md)

Some steps are given here :
```
$ cd micropython
$ make -C mpy-cross
```

Then to build MicroPython for the ESP32 run (assuming IDF is already installed):

```
$ cd ports/esp32
```
modify mpconfigport.h and add the following (after `#ifndef MICROPY_UNIX_MINIMAL` for example)

```
#define MICROPY_PY_URE_SUB 40
#define MICROPY_PY_URE_MATCH_GROUPS         (1)
#define MICROPY_PY_URE_MATCH_SPAN_START_END (1)
```

Then compile micropython firmware and flash the ESP32.

```
$ make submodules
$ make BOARD=GENERIC_SPIRAM
$ idf.py -D MICROPY_BOARD=GENERIC_SPIRAM -B build-GENERIC_SPIRAM  -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 460800 erase_flash
$ idf.py -D MICROPY_BOARD=GENERIC_SPIRAM -B build-GENERIC_SPIRAM  -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 460800 flash
```

## Upload mRDFLib files on ESP32
You may skip this step if you just need to test it on Linux with micropython.
The step is to upload the files on ESP32. 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ksingh25/mrdflib.git
$ cd mrdflib
```
Upload all the files manually or use the copy.py script or WebREPL over WiFi. 
**Uploading files over UART takes around 7 to 10 minutes.** In future, baudrate may be increased or 
transfer through WiFi may be used (telnet, ftp, webrepl, http, etc.).  
mRDFLib is around 800KB and thus the aim is also to reduce its size.

Assuming that the port is /dev/ttyUSB0:

`$ python3 copy.py /dev/ttyUSB0`

or copy them one by one using ampy:
```
$ ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 115200 put wlan.py
...
```


## Test some examples
On ESP32, you may enter the terminal using picocom.
**Note that first import and first script takes several seconds to run.**
After that it is much faster.
One may try directly uploading the compiled .pyc files for better execution speed.

```
$ picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0

>>> import gc
>>> gc.mem_free()
```

With last two commands please check if 4MB (around 400000) memory is available.

1. Add some facts to the graph and serialize them in different formats.
```
>>> execfile('example_serialize.py')

2. Input a string containing RDF triples, add triples to the RDF store, serialize the graph to JSON-LD format 

```
>>> execfile('example_sosa.py')

--- end: JSON-LD ---
```


3. Download a file over http (**currently https is not working and needs debugging**), parse and serialize it.

Download and put the modified [foaf.n3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksingh25/Files/main/foaf.n3) file in some folder on your PC. Then run a simple HTTP Server to make it accessible on web. Original foaf file has some special characters which are causing problems for parsing.

On your PC `cd` to the folder containing foaf.n3 file and start the server:

`sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80`

Now to the ESP32 (using picocom)

Please put the ip address of the local pc (hosting modified foaf.n3) in the file example_parse_foaf.py and upload it to ESP32.

`ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 115200 put example_parse_foaf.py`

Then please add WiFi SSID and password to wlan.py and upload it to ESP32.

`ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 115200 put wlan.py`

Connect to ESP32 terminal:

`picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0`

Connect ESP32 to WiFi and launch example_parse_foaf.py
```
>>> execfile('wlan.py')
network config: ('192.168.0.20', '255.255.255.0', '192.168.0.254', '8.8.8.8')
>>> execfile('example_parse_foaf.py')
...
```
This downloads the whole foaf.n3, parses it and prints the triples on the terminal.
