# mrdflib
mRDFLib is a port of [RDFLib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib) for micropython for working with RDF. 
It is a work in progress and the goal is to make the code as well as memory footprint as small as possible. 
Currently XML, isodate, Decimal (and thus _XSD_DECIMAL, _XSD_DATETIME, _XSD_DATE, etc.) are not supported. 

mRDFLib has been tested by compiling [micropython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) on Linux and ESP32 (with 4MB PSRAM for example esp32-one, ESP32 cam, ESP32-S3 with PSRAM etc. Note that ESP32-S3 is new and needs a separate compilation of firmware.).

## Prerequisites
To test it quickly, one either needs linux with python3 or ESP32 with 4MB of SPIRAM. 
For testing over ESP32, one needs to install [IDF (tested with v4.0.2)](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf), adafruit-ampy, picocom).

## Linux 
To test it on Linux, please compile the [micropython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) with advanced REGEX options enabled. This can be done by modifying
micropython/ports/unix/mpconfigport.h

and adding the following (after `#ifndef MICROPY_UNIX_MINIMAL` for example)

```
#define MICROPY_PY_URE_SUB 40
#define MICROPY_PY_URE_MATCH_GROUPS         (1)
#define MICROPY_PY_URE_MATCH_SPAN_START_END (1)
```

## ESP32
To test it on ESP32, please install [IDF (tested with v4.0.2)](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf), download [micropython code](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) 
cd to `micropython/ports/esp32` directory and then compile and flash the firware
check some intial steps [here](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/ports/esp32/README.md)

Some steps are given here :
```
$ cd micropython
$ make -C mpy-cross
```

Then to build MicroPython for the ESP32 run (assuming IDF is already installed):

```
$ cd ports/esp32
$ make submodules
$ make BOARD=GENERIC_SPIRAM
$ idf.py -D MICROPY_BOARD=GENERIC_SPIRAM -B build-GENERIC_SPIRAM  -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 460800 erase_flash
$ idf.py -D MICROPY_BOARD=GENERIC_SPIRAM -B build-GENERIC_SPIRAM  -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 460800 flash`
```

## Upload files on ESP32
You may skip this step if you just need to test it on Linux with micropython.
The step is to upload the files on ESP32. 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ksingh25/mrdflib.git
$ cd mRDFLib
```
Upload all the files manually or use the copy.py script or WebREPL over WiFi. Uploading files over UART takes around 7 to 10 minutes. 
mRDFLib is around 800KB and thus the next step will be to reduce its size.

Assuming that the port is /dev/ttyUSB0:

`$ python3 copy.py /dev/ttyUSB0`

or copy them one by one using ampy:
```
$ ampy --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 115200 run wlan.py
...
```


## Test some examples
You may enter the terminal using picocom.

`$ picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0`

1. Add some facts to the graph and serialize them in different formats.
```
>>> execfile('example_serialize.py')

RDF Serializations:
--- start: turtle ---

--- end: turtle ---
...
```

2. Input a string containing RDF triples, add triples to the RDF store, serialize the graph to JSON-LD format 

```
>>> execfile('example_sosa.py')
Warning: parser.py BytesIOWrapper not supported

--- end: JSON-LD ---
```


3. Download a file over http (**currently https is not working and needs debugging**), parse and serialize it.

Download and put the modified [foaf.n3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ksingh25/Files/main/foaf.n3) file in some folder on your PC. Then run a simple HTTP Server to make it accessible on web. Original foaf file has some special characters which are causing problems for parsing.

On your PC `cd` to the folder containing foaf.n3 file and start the server:

`sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80`

Now to the ESP32 (using picocom)

Please put the ip address of the local pc (hosting modified foaf.n3) in the file example_parse_foaf.py and upload it to ESP32.
`ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 115200 put example_parse_foaf.py`

Connect to ESP32 terminal:

`picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0`

Connect ESP32 to WiFi and launch example_parse_foaf.py
```
>>> execfile('wlan.py')
network config: ('192.168.0.20', '255.255.255.0', '192.168.0.254', '212.27.40.241')
>>> execfile('example_parse_foaf.py')
...
```
This downloads the whole foaf.n3, parses it and prints the triples on the terminal.
